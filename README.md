# INST737 Team 8 code

In our project for INST737: Introduction to Data Science, we applied diverse statistical and machine learning techniques to predict crucial metrics such as applicant numbers, views, and salary using a comprehensive LinkedIn Job Postings database. Utilizing R for data exploration, programming, and visualization, we implemented a range of algorithms—from Linear Regression to Neural Networks—for developing predictive models. Additionally, we executed meticulous feature selection and evaluation techniques, utilizing various metrics like precision, recall, correlation matrices, and more. Collaborating within a team-centric setting, we effectively translated complex data-driven insights into clear, digestible outcomes.

All Predictive Models created using R Programming Language. Data Cleaning was done using Microsoft Excels
